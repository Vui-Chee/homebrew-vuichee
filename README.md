## My Brew Tap

A place to host all my custom casks and formula.

## Installation

Run `brew tap vui-chee/homebrew-vuichee` to add my tap.

For example to install my tetris app, run `brew install tetris`.

In general, run `brew install [filename]`, based on the filename inside
`Casks` or `Formula` folders.

## Updating

To update formula, run `brew update`.

If anything is outdated, run `brew upgrade [filename]`
