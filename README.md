## My Brew Tap

A place to host all my custom casks and formula.

## Installation

Run `brew tap vui-chee/homebrew-vuichee` to add my tap.

For example to install my tetris app, run `brew install tetris`.

In general, run `brew install [filename]`, based on the filename inside
`Casks` or `Formula` folders.

## Updating

To update formula, run `brew update`.

If anything is outdated, run `brew upgrade [filename]`

## Update Issue

If you already installed the previous version and tried to run `brew update` but failed,
you may need to run `brew tap --repair [filename]`.
